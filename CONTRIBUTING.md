Contribution Guidelines
Thank you for your interest in Pulse!

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. 

This project has adopted the Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct. For more information see the Code of Conduct FAQ or contact opencode@microsoft.com with any additional questions or comments.

Contributions come in many forms: submitting issues, writing code, participating in discussions and community calls.

This document provides the guidelines for how to contribute to the Pulse project.

Issues
This section describes the guidelines for submitting issues

Issue Types
There are 4 types of issues:

Issue/Bug: You've found a bug with the code, and want to report it, or create an issue to track the bug.
Issue/Discussion: You have something on your mind, which requires input form others in a discussion, before it eventually manifests as a proposal.
Issue/Proposal: Used for items that propose a new idea or functionality. This allows feedback from others before code is written.
Issue/Question: Use this issue type, if you need help or have a question.
Before You File
Before you file an issue, make sure you've checked the following:

Is it the right repository?
The Pulse project is distributed across multiple repositories. Check the list of repositories if you aren't sure which repo is the correct one.
Check for existing issues
Before you create a new issue, please do a search in open issues to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.
If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your reaction. Use a reaction:
üëç up-vote
üëé down-vote
For bugs
Check it's not an environment issue. For example, if running on Kubernetes, make sure prerequisites are in place. (state stores, bindings, etc.)
You have as much data as possible. This usually comes in the form of logs and/or stacktrace. If running on Kubernetes or other environment, look at the logs of the Pulse services (runtime, operator, placement service). More details on how to get logs can be found here.
For proposals
Many changes to the Pulse runtime may require changes to the API. In that case, the best place to discuss the potential feature is the main Pulse repo.
Other examples could include bindings, state stores or entirely new components.

Pull Requests
All contributions come through pull requests. To submit a proposed change, we recommend following this workflow:

Make sure there's an issue (bug or proposal) raised, which sets the expectations for the contribution you are about to make.
Fork the relevant repo and create a new branch
Create your change
Code changes require tests
Update relevant documentation for the change
Commit and open a PR
Wait for the CI process to finish and make sure all checks are green
A maintainer of the project will be assigned, and you can expect a review within a few days
Use work-in-progress PRs for early feedback
A good way to communicate before investing too much time is to create a "Work-in-progress" PR and share it with your reviewers. The standard way of doing this is to add a "[WIP]" prefix in your PR's title and assign the do-not-merge label. This will let people looking at your PR know that it is not well baked yet.

Use of Third-party code
All third-party code must be placed in the vendor/ folder.
vendor/ folder is managed by Go modules and stores the source code of third-party Go dependencies. - The vendor/ folder should not be modified manually.
Third-party code must include licenses.
A non-exclusive list of code that must be places in vendor/:

Open source, free software, or commercially-licensed code.
Tools or libraries or protocols that are open source, free software, or commercially licensed.
Thank You! - Your contributions to open source, large or small, make projects like this possible. Thank you for taking the time to contribute.
